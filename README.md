Oneshot Legacy
==============

This is the source code for the launcher and miscellaneous tools for the
original RPG Maker 2003 edition of Oneshot. It's based on an older version
of [RPGLauncer](https://github.com/mathewv/rpglauncher) and I don't recommend
that you use it at all in your personal projects. It's here mostly for
educational purposes and completeness's sake, I guess.

(Seriously, use any RPG Maker made after XP or some other engine entirely
instead of trying to be clever and hack around with 2k3.)
